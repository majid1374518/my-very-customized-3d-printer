This is a 3d printer mechanical designed and it's cartesian based 3dprinter which move in x and y axis 
by ballscrew for minimize the back lash and use 4 z-axis motors with lead screw because z doesn't have very much movement and back lash 
because the weight is reduse backlash and always have 1 direction pressure. 
Why i used 4 motor for z-axis because of aute real bed leveling.
